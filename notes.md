*Here are a few suggestions to improve the input format for restaurant opening hours:*

- Provide additional information: To cater to the client's needs, the input format can be extended to include more information, such as opening hours on holidays, or different timings during the summer or winter months. This information can be added as key-value pairs in the input JSON to make it more comprehensive.

- Use a separate field for closed days: Instead of using an empty array to represent that a restaurant is closed on a specific day, consider using a dedicated field like "closed" to avoid confusion and make the input format more explicit.

- Use a standardized vocabulary: It's advisable to use a standardized vocabulary like the "openingHoursSpecification" vocabulary defined by Schema.org for the "type" field. This ensures consistency and interoperability across different systems that consume the data. You can find more information about the "openingHoursSpecification" vocabulary on the Schema.org website: https://schema.org/OpeningHoursSpecification.
